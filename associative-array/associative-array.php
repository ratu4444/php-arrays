<!--        What is ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY?-->
<!--        Ans: An associative array is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to retrieve the corresponding value.-->

<!--        Example of an Associative Array.-->

<?php
$super_store_employees = ["Amy"=>"Jonas", "Glenn"=>"Jerusha", "Dina"=>"Garet", "Sandra"=>"Jerry", "Meteo"=>"Jeff", "Cheyene"=>"Bo"];
print_r($super_store_employees);
?>

<!--        In this Associative Array "AMY" is key and "Jonas" is value.-->
